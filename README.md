# Vesting Contract

Vest your ERC20 tokens or ethers with this tested solidity smart contract.

## About the code

I wrote everything commenting every line, so it should be really easy to understand the logic.

This was one of my first developed contracts with Solidity and I remember how proud I was when I completed it.

## Warning

If you want to test it, I developed tests to BUT!..

To test the withdraw funcion (test 5 of 6 in LockedWalletTest.js) you will need to add a ERC20 Token contract.
